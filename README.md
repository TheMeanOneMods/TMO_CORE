# TMO_CORE


What Does This Mod Do?
TMO-Core, is the new backbone for TheMeanOneMods in 7 Days to Die, providing core utilities and compatibility for more advanced Modlets that are coming. It ensures a stable foundation, with simple support features for now and advanced enhancements (e.g., mod integration, settings) coming soon to elevate your zombie survival experience. And while its not near finished, it serves for now as the basic foundation for my Modlets that require it.


Does It Work on Client or Server? EAC?
This Mod can work on ServerSide only alone. Especially as its a Dependency for my latest Mods. I will be pushing the bounds of ServerSide Mods. 
EAC Friendly! If you run this locally, EAC needs to be off.

Extra Notes:
Include the TFP Harmony Folder in your Mods Folder to enable this mod.
